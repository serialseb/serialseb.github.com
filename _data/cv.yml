summary: |
  Keen open-source advocate and contributor, I'm also a ReST proponent, long-time agilist, distributed systems aficionado, and involved in all things .net.

  Code has been my passion for 20 years, since the 90s and the glorious days of Netscape 1.1, when I wrote my first website.

  I've worked with companies large and small, and delivered large-scale public-facing systems, boutique applications and financial systems.

  Learning and sharing is fundamental to what I do, so I've given many talks and attend conferences. As an added bonus, _je parle également francais_ (I'm also fluent in French).
