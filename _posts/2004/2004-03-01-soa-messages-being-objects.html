   <p>
      In the latest event in the discussion about SOA and objects with Steve, he <a href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/seichert/archive/2004/03/01/8172.aspx">responds</a> to
      me the following:&#160;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d argue that you are passing objects, they&rsquo;re
      just wrapped up in messages.&rdquo;
   </p>
   <p>
      Steve, yes, my point is to support your previous assessments that what matters is
      not how are your objects on the inside done or how much logic they may have, but the
      WSDL and the XSD, and the policy, applied to your service (in a WS based service).
      But to understand my point, I&rsquo;ll go back to what I said <a href="{% post_url _posts/2004/2004-03-01-soa-debate-still-hot %}">here</a>:
      the ASMX is evil in the sense that it convinces people there&rsquo;s no difference
      between expressing an object in XML (serialization) and passing XML messages around.
      This assumption is only valid in simple cases.
   </p>
   <p>
      Let&rsquo;s make a simple comparison: Is a word document better off being a dump of
      the object layout in word, or as an xml document? Which one is tightly couple and
      a maintenance hell? Which one can support versioning and the open content model, <b>and</b> things
      like inherit by extension? Response: The first was the word file format, a mess to
      keep backward compatible according to office devs, and difficult to envolve. And it
      was exactly that, an OLE Stream file&hellip;

      Objects limit you to a CLR view. The problem with starting from saying you map objects
      in XML is that you:
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>
      1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span> Restrict
      your view of how other systems are going to consume your web service, that won&rsquo;t
      use the same objects as you, or the same language, or the same platform, or even the
      same paradigm. There ARE going to be a lot of people using batch files to query web
      services. I&rsquo;m already doing it, and it&rsquo;s far more productive for certain
      tasks than code.
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>
      2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span> Restrict
      your view on how extensible your data will be. An object can only be modified through
      inheritance or interfaces in the .net world. In the xsd world, validation is there,
      inheritance by restriction and inheritance by extension. These intrinsic values of
      XML are lost when you try to stick with objects.<br />
      Let me expand a bit. When you map on objects, you either map to an XmlNode for the
      open content model, or you die upon deserialization. You are sensitive to changes
      in the data being sent. If you deal with an xml message, you don&rsquo;t really care
      what is happening in the extension points you provide. You&rsquo;ll always be able
      to ignore the data not interesting to you, and access what you need. You&rsquo;re
      more open.
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>
      3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span> End
      up providing a bad message format, as you don&rsquo;t design your xsd first. I agree
      that not everybody agrees on contract design first, but I strongly do, and believe
      that the architects around the world should unite to speak as one voice for schema
      design first. Why design first? Because you can then talk about the schema as being
      the contract of your service, and very early know what your service is doing, why,
      and how. And you let other people expand it.
   </p>
   <p>
      I&rsquo;m not saying asmx is the source of all things evil (although I&rsquo;m tempted).
      I&rsquo;m saying that to think about the object mapping feature of asmx as the way
      to go works only in simple cases no gateway no proxy no router no header processing
      no non-.net or no non-oolanguage cases. As soon as you try and move forward&hellip;
      It becomes so much more complex.
