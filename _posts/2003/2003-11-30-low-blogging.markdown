Sorry for the low blogging these days. Since friday I can hardly see anything, because of a cornea infiltration. This causes swollen eyes (frankly I look like a monster, with one eye full of blood), and gives a very blurry and incomfortable vision. Am going to the hospital once again today, hope my vision will increase tomorrow to be back coding and blogging.

This is the moment you realize that, as a coder, without your eyes or your hands, you can do nothing. Pretty frightening.

Thanks to all my dedicated readers for bearing with me in the meantime.
