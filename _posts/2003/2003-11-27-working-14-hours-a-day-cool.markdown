[Aaron](http://www.brethorsting.com/blog/archives/000091.html) tells us that working 14 hours a day is cool for him. I can certainly understand that. For many years, I was nearly coding 10 hours a day (yes, I was even coding during my lessons at school!). After a while, you just loose interest. Not in code, I’m still coding a lot. But after a few years, you learn to like things that you do with your family. It is difficult to deal with both coding, weblogging and family life, and like many things, it’s a question of concessions between your frustration and the frustration of your partner. But at the end of the night, you feel quite relaxed of a no coding night. You’ll learn to love to have two lives, coder and husband.

You know, I start talking like someone in his forty’s. This is frightening.
