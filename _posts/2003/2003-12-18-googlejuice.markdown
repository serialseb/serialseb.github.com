I just looked at my googlerank (you can never be too self-conscious), and guess what. Here are the few way to get me in the first page:

Sebastien (7)
Lambla (1 and 2)
 TheTechnologist(2)
Longhorn WinFS (4)
Longhorn Peer2peer (3)
Longhorn SOA (10)

Quite interesting considering the lack of proper content that has been uploaded there.

The bad thing is that I’m moving houses again, and my web site will be completely disconnected from the 20th of December, up to the 3rd of January 2004. To my dear readers, don’t unsubscribe, this is only temporary! Great content will start appearing as soon as I get back from holidays. Thanks for your patience.
