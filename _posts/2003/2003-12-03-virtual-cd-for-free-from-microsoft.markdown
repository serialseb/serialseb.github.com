A very handy utility is to be able to mount iso files as real cds. Microsoft have a [Virtual CD-ROM Control Panel for Windows XP](http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/b/6/7b6abd84-7841-4978-96f5-bd58df02efa2/winxpvirtualcdcontrolpanel_21.exe) for that. From [Scott](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=a37b2934-badd-4482-a949-552af45bc3b0). Cool.
