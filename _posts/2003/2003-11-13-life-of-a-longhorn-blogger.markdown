No new posts tonight. Scoble talked about it a while back, but when life becomes busy, things have a tendancy to go bad, especially if they can.

Being a geek, I’m working on Longhorn. I have side projects which sucks a lot of my coding time already. My day work is exhaustingly linear in the amount of coding I do. I also have a family life. Here is my schedule:



-          7, wake up. Try to.

-          8 wake up, really.

-          9, at work up and running

-          11, at work, starts coding (can’t before)

-          Day goes on

-          17:30, stop working

-          18:30 really stop working and go home

-          19:00 maximum, Gym (4 times a week)

-          20:30, dinner. After that, movie. No choice here, it’s the “right thing to do” to get your half off your toes

-          23:00, try to catch up on blogs, newsgroups, and code

-          Now, here, depends on a lot of factors. You can get into troubles and have a few fights with your half about your so called lack of attention (even though you’re paying for both and working 10 hours a day to get more money home, sacrifice your week ends and most of your coding time, just to be able to keep a survivable standard for the household while you’re the only one with a job).

-          So tonight I was heading to bed, but after not going to bed exactly 10 seconds after my half stood up to get there, fight. I’m in no mood to go to bed now. But I’m tired, so I’ll go anyway.

Boring kind of “how a busy life can suck up most of your joy” on a depressive night.

How do married geeks out there can handle that kind of situations? Comments welcomed.
