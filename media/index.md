# Speaker bio
Here you can find a few bios you can use for your conference.

## Short
Sebastien, open-source adovcate, defender of diversity, promoter of not too bad
architecture, does what he can to build software that is "not too shabby".

## Longer
Sebastien has been clogging the internet tubes since 1994, when he started on a long journey of discussing technical matters and unicorns.
He is known for having been a keen open-source advocate, sometimes even contributor, a distributed systems aficionado, a ReST proponent, a speaker, a trainer, an architect, a diversity advocate, and anything that he's managed to put his hands on.
His passion has lead him to creating bugs in most languages.

## Much longer or something else
