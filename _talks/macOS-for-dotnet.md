title: macOS for the .net dev
summary: |
  So you're a .net developer, and you're through with Windows. It's not him, it's you, you've just grown apart, and after spending so much time with macOS, you're ready to move on.
  From replacing tools like process explorer, to learning the basics of bash, becoming friend with Terminal, we'll  write our first macOS .net core app, edit old 2005 projects, and even see how to still compile on windows with packer for when things just plain don't work. So come along and see for yourself if, this year, hell has really frozen over.
