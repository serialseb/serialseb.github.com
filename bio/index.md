Hello and welcome!

I'm Sebastien and I love building software. I split my time between open-source
contributions, training, speaking, and building distributed systems for
clients all over the world.

Open-Source is now an essential part of our industry. I contribute as much as I
can, with projects such as [ConsulStructure][consul], [OpenRasta][openrasta] and
many other [side projects][side], both to advance the state of our industry, and to
experiment and keep my coding as sharp as possible.

Theres little value in learning if you don't share it back. I train developers
in modern development practices, ReST architectures and distributed systems.

Another way to teach is to speak at conferences, an essential part in motivating
the industry, and floating new ideas. With [over 100 talk deliveries][talks]
over 10 years, I've been lucky enough to travel extensively to share my passion.

Publishing content for people to read at home is the last part of this sharing
equation. [My blog][blog] goes back to 2003, and in a commitment to integrity, I've
even left the embarassing material.
