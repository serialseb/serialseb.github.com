 > I worked with Seb for nearly a year at a mutual client of ours; he demonstrated an enlightening depth of knowledge in his areas of expertise he is superb at spotting problems which can be solved with already discovered patterns. He has strong opinions on everything and is always willing to apply pragmatism when building software. He is worth hiring and always worth listening to - there are many things to be learned from him.

> I used OpenRasta during a code "boot-camp" to teach developers about ReST. We spent about 1 hour total talking about 
> ReSt and some different theory. We then spent the next 3 hours showing and writing code. We created a basic CRUD
> style controller, put some basic authentication into the pipeline and had a working service up and running by the time
> the class was over. The feedback was great, and for most people it was easy to use OpenRasta to learn ReST.

> Seb has always been a great inspiration to me. Being an API guy myself, I've always looked up to him and if it wasn't for OpenRasta I wouldn't be where I am in my career. Thanks for that!

Filip W, developer and all that

> Sebastien delivered an outstanding session about RESTful API:s and hypermedia during Øredev 2011. But what's equally
> important - he really took the time to hang around the conference talking and debating with any attendee that
> approached him. This is what makes a conference great, speakers, like Sebastien, that takes the time to have all those
> discussions between the sessions.

> Sebastien Lambla is purely brilliant! Not only is he extremely talented, but he is hard working and always well
> prepared and innovative. Most of the projects I had the pleasure of working with him on involved highly complex
> scenarios that were all presenting high risks. Sebastien always came to the table with innovative solutions that not
> only looked amazing, but worked perfectly. I would work with him again without hesitation.

Sebastien Rousseau, project manager, AKQA
