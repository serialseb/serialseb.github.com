> Seb is an intelligent, respected, and accomplished technologist. He was a huge personal help to me in ramping up on REST and provide my team continual advice as we were developing ASP.NET Web API. He is also a passionate supporter of the UK developer community having also been a big driver for the UK alt.net efforts.

> Seb is articulate, passionate, courageous and fiercely intelligent; exactly the kind of person you want to have around
> if you've got difficult problems to solve. I enjoyed working with him immensely and wouldn't hesitate to do so again.

> I used OpenRasta during a code "boot-camp" to teach developers about ReST. We spent about 1 hour total talking about 
> ReSt and some different theory. We then spent the next 3 hours showing and writing code. We created a basic CRUD
> style controller, put some basic authentication into the pipeline and had a working service up and running by the time
> the class was over. The feedback was great, and for most people it was easy to use OpenRasta to learn ReST.

Nate Taylor, developer

> Seb has always been a great inspiration to me. Being an API guy myself, I've always looked up to him and if it wasn't for OpenRasta I wouldn't be where I am in my career. Thanks for that!

Filip W, developer and all that

> Sebastien delivered an outstanding session about RESTful API:s and hypermedia during Øredev 2011. But what's equally
> important - he really took the time to hang around the conference talking and debating with any attendee that
> approached him. This is what makes a conference great, speakers, like Sebastien, that takes the time to have all those
> discussions between the sessions.

Peter von Lochow, Member of Program Committee, Öredev AB

> Expert, High Integrity, Creative

Colin Jack, developer

> Sebastien Lambla is purely brilliant! Not only is he extremely talented, but he is hard working and always well
> prepared and innovative. Most of the projects I had the pleasure of working with him on involved highly complex
> scenarios that were all presenting high risks. Sebastien always came to the table with innovative solutions that not
> only looked amazing, but worked perfectly. I would work with him again without hesitation.

Sebastien Rousseau, project manager, AKQA

> Sebastien is an excellent software developer with tremendous experience of delivering software with the latest
